# MessyData2

Technology is rapidly evolving and changing the way we work with data. One example of this is the emergence of advanced language models like ChatGPT, which can generate data for analytical purposes.
In this analysis, I'll be showcasing my SQL skills by cleaning a dataset of 35 rows and 5 columns, which was generated by ChatGPT. By leveraging cutting-edge technology, we can access larger and more diverse datasets than ever before, and use them to uncover new insights and trends.

It started with me asking chatgpt to provide messy data of 50100 rows. We had to go back and forth but it could only provide as much as 35 rows in a codebox.

I settled for the data I got, and headed straight to Microsoft SQL SERVER to begin computation and Cleaning.

## CREATING A TABLE INTO AN EXISTING DATABASE. 
I created a database named Customer_Profile on the server workbench. 
my next step was to create a Table into the database.

I figured I had added an extra column with the same feature (Phone and PhoneNumber) and I have to drop one of them. And it had to be the Phonecolumn.
