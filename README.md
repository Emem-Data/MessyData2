# MessyData2

Technology is rapidly evolving and changing the way we work with data. One example of this is the emergence of advanced language models like ChatGPT, which can generate data for analytical purposes.
In this analysis, I'll be showcasing my SQL skills by cleaning a dataset of 35 rows and 5 columns, which was generated by ChatGPT. By leveraging cutting-edge technology, we can access larger and more diverse datasets than ever before, and use them to uncover new insights and trends.

It started with me asking chatgpt to provide messy data of 50100 rows. We had to go back and forth but it could only provide as much as 35 rows in a codebox.
